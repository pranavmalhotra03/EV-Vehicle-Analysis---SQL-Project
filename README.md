‚ö° ELECTRIC VEHICLE DATA ANALYSIS USING SQL
This project explores a real-world electric vehicle (EV) dataset to uncover performance trends, efficiency insights, and segment-based comparisons using SQL.
It demonstrates the analytical mindset and technical skills expected from a professional data analyst.
More than 10+ queries are written using SQL Server, applying concepts like filtering, grouping, CTEs, subqueries, and window functions.

üì¶ Dataset Overview
This dataset contains detailed specifications of various electric vehicles, including:
‚Ä¢	Brand & Model: The name of the EV and its manufacturer
‚Ä¢	Range & Efficiency: Maximum distance per charge and energy consumption (Wh/km)
‚Ä¢	Performance: Acceleration (0‚Äì100 km/h) and top speed
‚Ä¢	Battery Details: Battery capacity (kWh), battery type, and DC fast charging capability
‚Ä¢	Utility Features: Number of seats, cargo volume (liters), and towing capacity
‚Ä¢	Classification: Car body type (e.g., SUV), vehicle segment, and drivetrain

üéØ Project Objectives
‚Ä¢	Clean and explore the EV dataset using SQL Server (SSMS)
‚Ä¢	Answer real-world business questions about electric vehicle specifications
‚Ä¢	Apply intermediate to advanced SQL techniques:
o	Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
o	Inline and correlated subqueries
o	Window functions like RANK, NTILE, and PERCENT_RANK
‚Ä¢	Simulate real-world data analysis often used in dashboards and reports

üõ† SQL Concepts Used
‚Ä¢	Aggregations ‚Äì for averages, totals, and model counts
‚Ä¢	Grouping & Filtering ‚Äì to analyze trends by segment, drivetrain, or brand
‚Ä¢	CTEs ‚Äì for building reusable logic for complex queries
‚Ä¢	Subqueries ‚Äì for comparing EVs to averages and segment leaders
‚Ä¢	Window Functions ‚Äì for rankings, quartiles, and percentiles
